        Serverless is most often seen as a way to host applications in a managed infrastructure so that it can scale based on need while enabling teams to focus more on the application. In this presentation, we will discuss how each part of the application lifecycle is improved by leveraging serverless from development, deployment, monitoring, security, disaster recovery, governance, and general management. This discussion will be most useful for development and operations teams who want to leverage serverless and understand the benefits & challenges at each stage in the application life cycle. Examples given here will be based on Azure Functions but should be applicable to all serverless environments.
