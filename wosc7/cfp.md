## Papers and Submissions
Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research/application papers that are not being considered in another forum.

Submitted manuscripts should be structured as technical papers and may not exceed six (6) single-spaced double-column pages using ACM SIGPLAN style, which can be found on the ACM template page. The page limit contains all the content, including bibliography, appendix, etc.

Submitted papers must adhere to the formatting instructions of the ACM SIGPLAN style, which can be found on the ACM template page. **The font size has to be set to 10pt**.

Note that submissions must be double-blind: authors’ names must not appear, and authors must make a good faith attempt to anonymize their submissions.

The Middleware conference organizers will provide companion proceedings including all workshop papers, which will be available in the ACM Digital Library. This is subject to the availability of their camera-ready papers by October 16, 2020.

Authors should submit the manuscript in PDF format. All manuscripts will be reviewed and will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, rigour in analysis, quality of results, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference attendees. Papers conforming to the above guidelines can be submitted through the paper submission system powered by HotCRP ([https://wosc6.hotcrp.com/](https://wosc6.hotcrp.com/)).

All submitted manuscripts (following MIDDLEWARE conference requirements on formatting and page limits) will be peer-reviewed by at least 3 program committee members. Accepted papers with confirmed presentation will appear in the conference proceedings as well as in the ACM Digital Library.
