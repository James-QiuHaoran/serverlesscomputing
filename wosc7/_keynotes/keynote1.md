New technology adoption is often a challenge within large organizations. If proven right, they can increase productivity, agility, and help us make better decisions. Serverless brings in a huge advantage of offloading infrastructure management to cloud providers so that enterprises can focus more on delivering features faster to their customers. In this talk, you will hear how T-Mobile developers have embraced serverless, our journey with examples of use-cases in T-Mobile, challenges encountered with adoption of serverless, and how we have used custom built tooling to simplify development workflows to abstract the complexity from developers and facilitate adoption.
