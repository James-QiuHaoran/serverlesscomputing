# Workshop Proposal 

## Title
5th International Workshop on Serverless Computing (WoSC5) part of 39th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS 2019) July 7th to 10th, in Dallas, Texas, USA.

### Brief Technical Description
Over the last four to five years, Serverless Computing (Serverless) has gained an enthusiastic following in industry as a compelling paradigm for the deployment of cloud applications, and is enabled by the recent shift of enterprise application architectures to containers and micro-services. Many of the major cloud vendors, have released serverless platforms, including Amazon Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Microsoft Azure Functions, IBM Cloud Functions. There is, however, little attention in serverless computing from the research community. This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners to discuss their experiences and thoughts on future directions.

### Interest to the Research Community
Serverless architectures offer different tradeoffs in terms of control, cost, and flexibility compared to distributed applications built on an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) substrate. For example, a serverless architecture requires developers to more carefully consider the resources used by their code (time to execute, memory used, etc.) when modularizing their applications. This is in contrast to concerns around latency, scalability, and elasticity, which is where significant development effort has traditionally been spent when building cloud services. In addition, tools and techniques to monitor and debug applications aren't applicable in serverless architectures, and new approaches are needed. As well, test and development pipelines may need to be adapted. Another decision that developers face are the appropriateness of the serverless ecosystem to their application requirements. A rich ecosystem of services built into the platform is typically easier to compose and would offer better performance. However, composing external services may be unavoidable, and in such cases, many of the benefits of serverless disappear, including performance and availability guarantees. This presents an important research challenge, and it is not clear how existing results and best practices, such as workflow composition research, can be applied to composition in a serverless environment.

By offering a workshop for this problem space in the context of ICDCS, we want to draw the attention of distributed systems researchers to this young research field and further drive the adoption and development of available technology.

### Review process

We will use EasyChair. All submitted manuscripts will be peer-reviewed by at least 3 program committee members. Accepted papers with confirmed presentation will appear in the conference proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press and will be made available online through the IEEE Digital Library, as well as through the ACM Digital Library.

### Primary contact of the organizing committee

Vinod Muthusamy, IBM Research

### Estimated number of participants, length, and timetable of the workshop

We expect the workshop length and agenda to be similar to the previous iterations of the workshop, which included invited talks, paper presentations, and panel discussions. We will provide a final agenda once we know the number of invited talks and accepted papers.

Approximate attendance: 30-50 participants

### Resources required 

We request room for a full day workshop, which will include talks by keynote speakers, authors of accepted papers, and a panel session. In the past, we have had between 30-50 people attend the workshop. If possible, we would also like to record the talks to post on the Web, and would appreciate any A/V assistance for this.

### Tentative call for papers

Serverless Computing (Serverless) is emerging as a new and compelling paradigm for the deployment of cloud applications, and is enabled by the recent shift of enterprise application architectures to containers and micro-services. Many of the major cloud vendors, have released serverless platforms, including Amazon Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Microsoft Azure Functions, IBM Cloud Functions. There is, however, little attention from the research community. This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners to discuss their experiences and thoughts on future directions.

Authors are invited to submit research papers, experience papers, demonstrations, or position papers.

Papers and Submissions

Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research/application papers that are not being considered in another forum.

Submitted manuscripts should be structured as technical papers and may not exceed six (6) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11 inch pages (IEEE conference style), including figures, tables, and references.

Authors should submit the manuscript in PDF format. All manuscripts will be reviewed and will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, rigour in analysis, quality of results, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference attendees. Papers conforming to the above guidelines can be submitted through the paper submission system https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wosc5 powered by EasyChair.org.

All submitted manuscripts will be peer-reviewed by at least 3 program committee members. Accepted papers (from both tracks and workshops) with confirmed presentation will appear in the conference proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press and will be made available online through the IEEE Digital Library, as well as through the ACM Digital Library.
