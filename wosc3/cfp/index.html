<p>
    Serverless Computing (Serverless) is emerging as a new and compelling paradigm for the deployment of cloud applications, and is enabled by the recent shift of enterprise application architectures to containers and micro services.  Many of the major cloud vendors, have released serverless platforms within the last two years, including Amazon Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Microsoft Azure Functions, IBM Cloud Functions. There is, however, little attention from the research community. This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners to discuss their experiences and thoughts on future directions.
</p>

<p>
    Serverless architectures offer different tradeoffs in terms of control, cost, and flexibility. For example, this requires developers to more carefully consider the resources used by their code (time to execute, memory used, etc.) when modularizing their applications. This is in contrast to concerns around latency, scalability, and elasticity, which is where significant development effort has traditionally been spent when building cloud services. In addition, tools and techniques to monitor and debug applications aren't applicable in serverless architectures, and new approaches are needed. As well, test and development pipelines may need to be adapted. Another decision that developers face are the appropriateness of the serverless ecosystem to their application requirements. A rich ecosystem of services built into the platform is typically easier to compose and would offer better performance. However, composing external services may be unavoidable, and in such cases, many of the benefits of serverless disappear, including performance and availability guarantees. This presents an important research challenge, and it is not clear how existing results and best practices, such as workflow composition research, can be applied to composition in a serverless environment.

Authors are invited to submit research papers, experience papers, demonstrations, or position papers.

<h2>
    Important Dates
</h2> 
<p>
    Paper Submission: February 14, 2018 (Extended Deadline)
    <br/>
    Notification of Acceptance: March 22, 2018
    <br/>
    Final Camera-Ready Manuscript Due: April 6, 2018
  </p>

<h2>
    Papers and Submissions
</h2>

<p>
    All submitted manuscripts will be peer-reviewed by at least 3 program committee members. Accepted papers (from both tracks and workshops) with confirmed presentation will appear in the conference proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press. 
</p>

<p>
    Submitted papers will be limited to 8 (IEEE Proceedings style) pages and REQUIRED to be formatted using the IEEE Proceedings template. Submitted Work-in-Progress Papers will be limited to 4 (IEEE Proceedings style) pages. Unformatted papers and papers beyond the page limit may not be reviewed. Electronic submission of manuscripts (in PDF format) is required.
</p>
    
<p>
    Manuscripts should be submitted to the IEEE CLOUD 2018 Paper Submission/Review System powered by EasyChair.org. Full-length papers should be submitted to the Research Track; and short papers be submitted to the Work-in-Progress Track. When submitting a full-length paper, one should select serverless workshop (single choice).
</p>

<p>
    All papers will be reviewed by the same program committee to ensure quality and consistency.
</p>

<p>
    For a paper submitted the Workshop Chair(s) will decide whether the paper be accepted or recommend to the Work-in-Progress Track for further consideration.
