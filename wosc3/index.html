  <h2 id='intro'>Welcome</h2>

<p>
Serverless Computing (Serverless) is emerging as a new and compelling paradigm for the deployment of cloud applications, and is enabled by the recent shift of enterprise application architectures to containers and micro services.  Many of the major cloud vendors, have released serverless platforms within the last two years, including Amazon Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Microsoft Azure Functions, IBM Cloud Functions. There is, however, little attention from the research community. This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners to discuss their experiences and thoughts on future directions.
</p><p>
Serverless architectures offer different tradeoffs in terms of control, cost, and flexibility. For example, this requires developers to more carefully consider the resources used by their code (time to execute, memory used, etc.) when modularizing their applications. This is in contrast to concerns around latency, scalability, and elasticity, which is where significant development effort has traditionally been spent when building cloud services. In addition, tools and techniques to monitor and debug applications aren't applicable in serverless architectures, and new approaches are needed. As well, test and development pipelines may need to be adapted. Another decision that developers face are the appropriateness of the serverless ecosystem to their application requirements. A rich ecosystem of services built into the platform is typically easier to compose and would offer better performance. However, composing external services may be unavoidable, and in such cases, many of the benefits of serverless disappear, including performance and availability guarantees. This presents an important research challenge, and it is not clear how existing results and best practices, such as workflow composition research, can be applied to composition in a serverless environment.

<h3 id='keynote'>Serverless: Where Have We Come? Where Are We Going?</h3>

<p>
  Keynote by Stephen J. Fink, Chief Architect, Watson Programming Models, IBM
</p>

<p>
  Abstract: Since Amazon Lambda arrived in November 2014, serverless technologies have taken the industry by storm,
  ascending quickly towards the summit of the hype cycle.   As we approach the summit, let's look
  at where we've come with serverless technology so far, in the context of larger industry trends.
  Then, let's discuss how the technology might evolve, identifying the most promising
  directions to help drive serverless into the mainstream.

<h3 id='pywren'>NumPyWren: Storage-enabled Scaling of Serverless Supercomputing</h3>

<p>
  Eric Jonas, UC Berkeley EECS and RISELab
</p>

<p>
    Abstract: The rise of serverless platforms has enabled transparent massive-scale parallelism via platforms such as PyWren. But PyWren is optimized for tasks that are embarrassingly parallel. Traditional supercomputing tasks, such as dense, large-scale linear algebra, are often thought to be dominated by inter-node communication performance. Here we will present NumPyWren, a platform for scalable large-scale dense linear algebra (analogous to packages such as SCALAPACK), which uses high-latency high-throughput scalable object storage (like S3) as its only means of communication. NumPyWren takes simple numpy-like expressions and compiles them to an intermediate representation and then transparently executes them entirely via stateless cloud functions, achieving performance comparable with MPI-based solutions while being much more compute (and thus cost)-efficient. We will discuss ongoing work to support a larger collection of mathematical primitives, how this fits into the larger PyWren project, and more.

<h3 id='stackery'>Conquering serverless: Solutions For Organizations</h3>

<p>
  Chase Douglas,	Co-founder and CTO of Stackery.io	
</p>

<p>
    Abstract: You get serverless. Your team gets serverless. But does your organization get serverless?
    <br/>
    You know a serverless architecture is the right solution for a project, but your VP of Engineering is pushing back. They are probably doing this because it's not obvious how a serverless architecture will fit into the organization's existing development, testing, and release processes. Their intuition that new techniques are needed to effectively maintain and extend serverless architectures is spot-on. But they can be convinced serverless is the right approach if you show them successful patterns.
  <br/>
    With patterns and examples from this talk, you will be able to convince everyone in your organization that serverless architectures are not only easier to build, but are also easier to maintain through the entire development life-cycle.

<h3 id='sparqtv'>Building and Teaching a Complete Serverless Solution</h3>

<p>
  Dr. Donald F. Ferguson
CTO and Co-Founder Sparq TV
Professor of Practice, Dept. of Computer Science, Columbia University
</p>

<p>
    Abstract: There are many definitions for and interpretations of the term "serverless computing." This presentation provides an architecture overview and delves into architecture
    details for a complete serverless application that a small startup has been developing since 2015. The presentation will cover Function-as-a-Service, security, data access
    and management, orchestration and workflow, content delivery and other topics. The complete application exploits approximately 25 core cloud services and environments.
    The presentation will discuss a set of best practices that have emerged and cover lessons learned. We will also discuss technical and research challenges and opportunities.
<br/>
    The solution forms the basis for a course at the Dept. of Computer Science at Columbia University. We will also cover issues and topics that have emerged in educating
    seniors and masters on how to build a simplified version of the application.

<h3 id='irobot'>Challenges for Serverless Native Cloud Applications</h3>

<p>
  Ben Kehoe,	Cloud Robotics Research Scientist	iRobot
</p>

<p>
    Abstract: Serverless computing, including the use of ephemeral compute like Functions as a Service (FaaS) and 3rd party managed services in preference to self-hosted solutions, has the power to reduce development effort, increase application robustness, and decrease operating expenses. While today it is common to use serverless architecture as part of a broader application that uses traditional architecture, "serverless native" applications already exist, and will become increasingly common in the future. iRobot supports its fleet of cloud-connected robots with an entirely serverless architecture, which has involved an extensive learning and exploration process. This talk will review the challenge of serverless native applications, including development, operations, and security.

<h3 id='p1'>Evaluation of Production Serverless Computing Environments	
</h3>

<p>Presenter: Hyungro Lee</p>

<p>
  Hyungro Lee, Kumar Satyam and Geoffrey Fox, Indiana University Bloomington, USA	  
</p>

<p>
    Abstract:
    Serverless computing provides a small runtime container to execute lines of codes without a management of infrastructure which is similar to Platform as a Service but a functional level. Amazon started the event-driven compute named Lambda functions in 2014 with a 25 concurrent limitation but it now supports at least a thousand of concurrent invocation to process event messages generated by resources like databases, storage and system logs. Other providers i.e. Google, Microsoft and IBM offer a dynamic scaling manager to handle parallel requests of stateless functions in which additional containers are provisioning on new compute nodes for distribution. However, while functions are often developed for microservices and lightweight workload, they are associated with distributed data processing using the concurrent invocations. We claim that the current serverless computing environments are able to support dynamic applications in parallel when a partitioned task is executable on a small function instance. We present results of throughput, network bandwidth, a file I/O and compute performance regarding to the concurrent invocations. We deployed a series of functions for large distributed data processing to address the elasticity and scalability and then demonstrate the differences between serverless computing and virtual machines for cost efficiency and resource utilization.

<h3 id='p2'>Serverless Data Analytics with Flint	

</h3>

<p>Presenter: Youngbin Kim</p>

<p>
  Youngbin Kim and Jimmy Lin, University of Waterloo,	Canada	
</p>

<p>
    Abstract:
    Serverless architectures organized around loosely-coupled function 
    invocations represent an emerging design for many applications. 
    Recent work mostly focuses on user-facing products and 
    event-driven processing pipelines. In this paper, we explore 
    a completely different part of the application space and examine the 
    feasibility of analytical processing on big data using a serverless 
    architecture. We present Flint, a prototype Spark execution engine 
    that takes advantage of AWS Lambda to provide a pure pay-as-you-go 
    cost model. With Flint, a developer uses PySpark exactly as before, 
    but without needing an actual Spark cluster. 
    We describe the design, implementation, 
    and performance of Flint, along with the challenges associated with 
    serverless analytics.

<h3 id='p3'>Making Serverless Computing More Serverless	</h3>

<p>
  Zaid Al-Ali, Sepideh Goodarzy, Ethan Hunter, Sangtae Ha, Richard Han and Eric Keller, CU Boulder, United States
  <br/>
  Eric Rozner, IBM Research,	United States	

</p>


<p>
    Abstract:
    In serverless computing, developers define a function 
to handle an event, and the serverless framework horizontally scales the 
application as needed. The downside of this function-based abstraction is it 
limits the type of application supported and 
places a bound on the function to be within the physical resource limitations of 
the server the function executes on. 
In this paper we propose a new abstraction for serverless computing. We propose a developer 
supplies a process and the serverless framework seamlessly scale out its resource usage across the datacenter. 
This abstraction enables processing to not only be 
more general purpose, but also break out of the 
limitations of a single server -- making serverless computing more serverless. 
To realize this abstraction, we propose ServerlessOS, 
comprised of three key components: (i) a new disaggregation model, which leverages disaggregation for abstraction, 
but enables resources to move fluidly between servers for performance; 
(ii) a cloud orchestration layer which manages fine-grained resource allocation and placement throughout 
the application's lifetime via local and global decision making; and 
(iii) an isolation capability that enforces data and resource isolation across disaggregation, effectively 
extending Linux cgroup functionality to span servers.

<h3 id='p4'>Challenges for Scheduling Scientific Workflows on Cloud Functions
</h3>

<p>Invited speaker: Maciej Malawski</p>

<p>
  Joanna Kijak, Piotr Martyna, Maciej Pawlik, Bartosz Balis and Maciej Malawski, AGH University of Science and Technology	Poland
</p>

<p>
    Abstract:
    Serverless computing model, also known as Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) or Cloud Functions, is a new method of running distributed applications by executing functions on the infrastructure of cloud providers. Although it frees the developers from configuring and maintaining servers, there are still decisions to make regarding selection of function based on the performance and cost. The billing model of this approach considers time of execution, measured in 100ms units, as well as size of the memory allocated per function.  In the talk we look into the  problem of scheduling scientific workflows, which are applications consisting of multiple tasks connected into a dependency graph. We discuss challenges related to workflow scheduling on the example of Serverless Deadline-Budget Workflow Scheduling (SDBWS) algorithm and preliminary experiments with a Montage astronomical workflow on AWS Lambda.
